      "\n",
      "Probabilistic Programming allows for automatic Bayesian inference on user-defined probabilistic models. Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamliltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source Probabilistic Programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other Probabilistic Programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Probabilistic programming (PP) allows flexible specification of Bayesian statistical models in code. PyMC3 is a new, open-source PP framework with an intuitive and readable, yet powerful, syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. It features next-generation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; Hoffman, 2014), a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC; Duane, 1987). This class of samplers works well on high dimensional and complex posterior distributions and allows many complex models to be fit without specialized knowledge about fitting algorithms. HMC and NUTS take advantage of gradient information from the likelihood to achieve much faster convergence than traditional sampling methods, especially for larger models. NUTS also has several self-tuning strategies for adaptively setting the tunable parameters of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which means you usually don't need to have specialized knowledge about how the algorithms work. PyMC3, Stan (Stan Development Team, 2014), and the LaplacesDemon package for R are currently the only PP packages to offer HMC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probabilistic programming in Python confers a number of advantages including multi-platform compatibility, an expressive yet clean and readable syntax, easy integration with other scientific libraries, and extensibility via C, C++, Fortran or Cython. These features make it relatively straightforward to write and use custom statistical distributions, samplers and transformation functions, as required by Bayesian analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "While most of PyMC3's user-facing features are written in pure Python, it leverages Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010) to transparently transcode models to C and compile them to machine code, thereby boosting performance. Theano is a library that allows expressions to be defined using generalized vector data structures called *tensors*, which are tightly integrated with the popular NumPy `ndarray` data structure, and similarly allow for broadcasting and advanced indexing, just as NumPy arrays do. Theano also automatically optimizes the likelihood's computational graph for speed and provides simple GPU integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, we present a primer on the use of PyMC3 for solving general Bayesian statistical inference and prediction problems. We will first see the basics of how to use PyMC3, motivated by a simple example: installation, data creation, model definition, model fitting and posterior analysis. Then we will cover two case studies and use them to show how to define and fit more sophisticated models. Finally we will show how to extend PyMC3 and discuss other useful features: the Generalized Linear Models subpackage, custom distributions, custom transformations and alternative storage backends."

NUTS is especially useful on models that have many continuous parameters, a situation where other MCMC algorithms work very slowly. It takes advantage of information about where regions of higher probability are, based on the gradient of the log posterior-density. This helps it achieve dramatically faster convergence on large problems than traditional sampling methods achieve. PyMC3 relies on Theano to analytically compute model gradients via automatic differentiation of the posterior density. NUTS also has several self-tuning strategies for adaptively setting the tunable parameters of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. For random variables that are undifferentiable (namely, discrete variables) NUTS cannot be used, but it may still be used on the differentiable variables in a model that contains undifferentiable variables. \n",

      "NUTS requires a scaling matrix parameter, which is analogous to the variance parameter for the jump proposal distribution in Metropolis-Hastings, although NUTS uses it somewhat differently. The matrix gives the rough shape of the distribution so that NUTS does not make jumps that are too large in some directions and too small in other directions. It is important to set this scaling parameter to a reasonable value to facilitate efficient sampling. This is especially true for models that have many unobserved stochastic random variables or models with highly non-normal posterior distributions. Poor scaling parameters will slow down NUTS significantly, sometimes almost stopping it completely. A reasonable starting point for sampling can also be important for efficient sampling, but not as often.\n",

Behind the scenes, a variable in the unconstrained space (named \"variableName_log\") is added to the model for sampling. In this model this happens behind the scenes for both the degrees of freedom, `nu`, and the scale parameter for the volatility process, `sigma`, since they both have exponential priors. Variables with priors that constrain them on two sides, like `Beta` or `Uniform`, are also transformed to be unconstrained but with a log odds transform. \n",

      "Although, unlike model specification in PyMC2, we do not typically provide starting points for variables at the model specification stage, we can also provide an initial value for any distribution (called a \"test value\") using the `testval` argument. This overrides the default test value for the distribution (usually the mean, median or mode of the distribution), and is most often useful if some values are illegal and we want to ensure we select a legal one. The test values for the distributions are also used as a starting point for sampling and optimization by default, though this is easily overriden. \n",

      "An important drawback of this approach is that it is not possible for `theano` to inspect these functions in order to compute the gradient required for the Hamiltonian-based samplers. Therefore, it is not possible to use the HMC or NUTS samplers for a model that uses such an operator. However, it is possible to add a gradient if we inherit from `theano.Op` instead of using `as_op`. The PyMC example set includes [a more elaborate example of the usage of as_op](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/blob/master/pymc3/examples/disaster_model_arbitrary_deterministic.py)."

For simple statistical distributions, the `DensityDist` function takes as an argument any function that calculates a log-probability $log(p(x))$. This function may employ other random variables in its calculation. Here is an example inspired by a blog post by Jake Vanderplas on which priors to use for a linear regression (Vanderplas, 2014). \n",

      "## Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Probabilistic programming is an emerging paradigm in statistical learning, of which Bayesian modeling is an important sub-discipline. The signature characteristics of probabilistic programming--specifying variables as probability distributions and conditioning variables on other variables and on observations--makes it a powerful tool for building models in a variety of settings, and over a range of model complexity. Accompanying the rise of probabilistic programming has been a burst of innovation in fitting methods for Bayesian models that represent notable improvement over existing MCMC methods. Yet, despite this expansion, there are few software packages available that have kept pace with the methodological innovation, and still fewer that allow non-expert users to implement models.\n",
      "\n",
      "PyMC3 provides a probabilistic programming platform for quantitative researchers to implement statistical models flexibly and succinctly. A large library of statistical distributions and several pre-defined fitting algorithms allows users to focus on the scientific problem at hand, rather than the implementation details of Bayesian modeling. The choice of Python as a development language, rather than a domain-specific language, means that PyMC3 users are able to work interactively to build models, introspect model objects, and debug or profile their work, using a dynamic, high-level programming language that is easy to learn. The modular, object-oriented design of PyMC3 means that adding new fitting algorithms or other features is straightforward. In addition, PyMC3 comes with several features not found in most other packages, most notably Hamiltonian-based samplers as well as automatical transforms of constrained random variables which is only offered by STAN. Unlike STAN, however, PyMC3 supports discrete variables as well as non-gradient based sampling algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings and Slice sampling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Development of PyMC3 is an ongoing effort and several features are planned for future versions. Most notably, variational inference techniques are often more efficient than MCMC sampling, at the cost of generalizability. More recently, however, black-box variational inference algorithms have been developed, such as automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI; Kucukelbir et al., in prep). This algorithm is slated for addition to PyMC3. As an open-source scientific computing toolkit, we encourage researchers developing new fitting algorithms for Bayesian models to provide reference implementations in PyMC3. Since samplers can be written in pure Python code, they can be implemented generally to make them work on arbitrary PyMC3 models, giving authors a larger audience to put their methods into use."
