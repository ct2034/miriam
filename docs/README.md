[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ct2034/miriam.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ct2034/miriam)

We are aiming to revolutionize the way intralogistics are managed. Our modular platform allows the orchestration and management of thousands of AGVs. Using deep learning we learn the best rules for each vehicle in order for it to avoid other vehicles and to assign transport tasks efficiently.
Additionally, the platform provides modules to support predictive maintenance through LSTM networks.
The platform will be developed open source and integrated with ROS.
